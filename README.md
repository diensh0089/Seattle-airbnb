# Seattle-airbnb
You can refer the following post for detailed understanding (https://medium.com/@dineshengg028/seattle-airbnb-analysis-d4ccf1427a57)

Project Introduction:

The objective of this project is to go through, analyze and study Seattle AirBnB dataset. In order to do that, and after a brief analysis, I found three questions worth to respond which would cover some interesting aspects. The article I published on Medium cover these questions in a non-technical sense and summarizes the main points, while the code provided in this file contains all calculus and technical procedures.

Dataset:
The dataset contains three files:
listings.csv - including full descriptions, average review scores and price of 3818 homestays.
reviews.csv - including 84849 reviewers' id and their detailed comments.
calendar.csv - including price of 3723 homestays in a year from 2016/1/4 to 2017/1/4.

Libraries:
All libraries I used in this project are as following:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
lightgbm
time

Resources:
It is fundamental to mention that I used other resources to get ideas on how to proceed with the analysis and to get some inspiration, mainly:
Pandas and matplotlib documentation
Stack Overflow and other forums
